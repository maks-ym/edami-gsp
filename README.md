### subtasks in the project
Maksym: pre-processing, post-processing, calculation of sequence support
Rahul: hash tree, creation of candidate sequences
Ruben: hierarchies

### Report
should contain:

- description of your task;
- assumptions you have made;
- description of the form of input and output data;
- all important design (e.g. class diagram(s)) and implementation issues;
- user guide (that is, how to use your program);
- all results generated by your program for a small input data;
- respective qualitative and quantitative results from experiments for at least 3 larger datasets  (runtime: partial for each important phase of implemented algorithms and total; numbers of performed operations of interest, numbers of patterns/clusters/trees and their cardinalities as well as their min., max., avg., standard deviation if reasonable; quality of classification etc.)
- your conclusions;
- references;
- and all other issues you find worth describing.

The final project report should be accompanied by source and executable files, used input data as well as resulting output data.

### Deadline
Each student has to present to how his/her program works no later than on June 9 (preferably on or before June 2, so that you have at least a week for eventual minor corrections).

This should be done during professor's project consulting hours.
